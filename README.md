# MATLAB-Lego-Robot
This was my final group Project for ME105 - MATLAB, for CSU Sacramento back in 2016.
It is a Lego Mind Storms Robot programmed with MATLAB. Sadly Lego Mind Storms is discontinued, though MATLAB is still in use.
The files uploaded instruct the Robot, in a car and claw configuration, to choose between two different cans of soda and knock over the correct one.
The robot was able to differentiate between a Coke and a Pepsi using its sensor.
The Vending GUI file opens up a working GUI in MATLAB that allows a user to pick between the Coke and Pepsi.
Upon selection the working button within the GUI calls upon the proper function (FindPepsi or FindCoke) and instructs it to find a can matching that description with its light sensor.
Upon finding the correct can it will activate its robot arm and knock the can over.
Finally it returns back to its starting position.
